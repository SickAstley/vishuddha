***Speak Unadulterated Hindi.***

## Explanation

Vishuddha is a searchable, filterable database of Hindi words.

Its purpose is to help you quickly find the Hindi terms for non-Hindi words that are usually being used. It is a step towards learning and using a purer form of the language.

**You can start using it [here](https://vishuddha.gatsbyjs.io/).**

## How To Contribute

### Contribute Method 1

Edit the file [Hindi.csv](./src/data/Hindi.csv) and start a pull request with your words to submit. Ensure you're maintaining the proper CSV format in alphabetical order to make merging as simple as possible.

### Contribute Method 2

Send an email to vishuddha.v2vd3@aleeas.com, containing an excel file in the following format:

- Excel must consist of 2 columns
  1. Non-Hindi word
  2. Corresponding Hindi word
- Use the email subject: "Vishuddha word request"

I will then update the spreadsheet myself.

### Notes
- Use multiple rows (one for each set of words) in case a non-Hindi word corresponds to multiple Hindi words or visa-versa.
- Do not contribute words newly posted by [@ShuddhaHindi](https://www.reddit.com/user/ShuddhaHindi) on Reddit. I keep updating them here regularly.

## Future Plans & Goals
- Implement a 'tap to copy' feature.
- Support for words in Devanagari.
